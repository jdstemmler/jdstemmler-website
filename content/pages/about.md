My name is Jayson Stemmler, I am a research scientist for the Department of Atmospheric Science at the University of Washington.
I work primarily with both in-situ and remote sensing data to investigate the relationship between clouds, aerosols, and climate.
In other words, I do a lot of processing and visualization of data from many different instruments and sources (including satellites)
to get a more comprehensive view of what's going on at a particular location or region. One example of this implementation is the
[ENA Data Browser website](http://ena-data.site) which allows for looking at multiple instruments and parameters in one place in order to
gain a better understanding of how a variety of atmospheric variables interact with each other.

Just about all of what I do is done in Python. The ENA data site is written using Flask, and I use a combination of python 2 and 3 depending
on which packages I need to use for a particular task. I'll use py3 where I can, but some of the older scientific libraries are not ported
over to py3 yet so I still need to use 2 for those. Much of the development is done using Jupyter Notebooks first and then breaking out
individual functionality into separate modules. I use git and GitHub for all version control.

While I currently work as an academic research scientist, my principal interest lies in data science.
In 2016 I attended an immersive data science course at Galvanize in downtown Seattle as a way to get more exposure and learn more about data science.
This was an excellent way to gain hands-on experience with a large variety of machine learning concepts, as well as learn more of the
technical details behind how the models function and work.

After the course was finished, I worked hard to bring much of what I learned into my academic research work. I have been able to
incorporate some of this interest into my work, but the particular applications that I am working on don't call for or require machine
learning or other common data science tools and methods. Because of this, I am off in search of new ways to develop more as a data scientist
and grow my career beyond data analysis and visualization.

I believe that having a strong background in academic research provides a solid foundation upon which to continue to build up my
skills as a data scientist, always keeping in mind that the key word in "data science" is **_science_**, not data.
